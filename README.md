## Projects

Here are some projects I''ve done:

- ([Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habit Analysis](https://github.com/nadianshafira/Consumer-Behavior-and-Shopping-Habit-Analysis)): Implemented an end-to-end data pipeline using Apache Airflow to analyze consumer behavior and shopping habits. Fetched data from PostgreSQL, conducted thorough cleaning, and visualized insights in Elasticsearch with Kibana. Key findings indicate that clothing items are the top-selling products, with both males and females purchasing over 1700 items, underscoring the significant demand for apparel in the market.
- ([Threads Application Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/nadianshafira/Threads-Application-Sentiment-Analysis)): Led a deep learning initiative focused on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to gain insights into usersâ€™ perspectives on the Threads application. The primary objective of this project was to conduct sentiment analysis using a variety of deep learning models. The results unveil the Long Short-Term Memory model outperformed others in accurately predicting user sentiment.
