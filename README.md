I'm a passionate Data Analyst and Data Scientist based in Jakarta, Indonesia.


## Projects

Here are some projects I''ve done:

- [**Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habit Analysis**](https://github.com/nadianshafira/Consumer-Behavior-and-Shopping-Habit-Analysis): Implemented an end-to-end data pipeline using Apache Airflow to analyze consumer behavior and shopping habits. Fetched data from PostgreSQL, conducted thorough cleaning, and visualized insights in Elasticsearch with Kibana. Key findings indicate that clothing items are the top-selling products, with both males and females purchasing over 1700 items, underscoring the significant demand for apparel in the market.
- [**Threads Application Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/nadianshafira/Threads-Application-Sentiment-Analysis): Led a deep learning initiative focused on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to gain insights into usersâ€™ perspectives on the Threads application. The primary objective of this project was to conduct sentiment analysis using a variety of deep learning models. The results unveil the Long Short-Term Memory model outperformed others in accurately predicting user sentiment.
- [**Heart Disease Risk Prediction**](https://github.com/nadianshafira/Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction): Executed a machine learning initiative employing classification to predict heart disease diagnosis. Results demonstrate that Support Vector Machine (SVM) stands out as the optimal model, achieving an 84% recall score in accurately identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.
- [**Android Users Preference towards Applications**](https://github.com/nadianshafira/Android-Users-Preference-toward-Applications): Examined the Android usersâ€™ preferences on the Google Play Store, revealing that game applications dominate installations with an average rating of 4.28. Additionally, a substantial 92.4% of users opt for free applications, highlighting a strong preference for unpaid offerings.
- [**Return on Investment Modeling**](https://github.com/nadianshafira/RKDU/tree/main): Conducted a comprehensive analysis of data from 8 pension fund institutions in the Special Capital Region of Jakarta and West Java using the panel data regression method. The result shows that the Return on Investment (ROI) is notably affected by the total assets of these institutions.
